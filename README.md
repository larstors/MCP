Repo for Methods of Computational Physics in WiSe 22/23

Not ideal, but each project has its own folder. The subjects of each folder/project is as follows

    - Project 1: Monte Carlo integration, importance sampling, random walk, and decay processes
    - Project 2: Monte Carlo Metropolis simulations of 1D Ising spin chain and 2D Ising spin (square) lattice
    - Project 3: Molecular dynamics 
        - Note: the code for project 3 is still wrong, so please proceed with caution if this is the project of interest
    - Project 4: Partial differential equations:
        - Laplace Equation
        - Diffusion
        - Solitons
    - Project 5: Quantum I:
        - Variantional Monte Carlo
        - Diffusive Monte Carlo
        - Path Integral Monte Carlo
