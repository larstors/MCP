Repo for Methods of Computational Physics in WiSe 22/23

Not ideal, but each project has its own folder. The subjects of each folder/project is as follows

    - Project 1: Monte Carlo integration, importance sampling, random walk, and decay processes
    - Project 2: Monte Carlo Metropolis simulations of 1D Ising spin chain and 2D Ising spin (square) lattice
    - Project 3: Molecular dynamics
